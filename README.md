# Memobook

A computer implementation of studying via lists instead of flashcards.

Extremely alpha state.  In the highly unlikely event that anyone besides me
wants to and succeeds in using this for anything beyond trying out the
hardcoded example material, chances are something will happen like a change to
the data format or corrupted review history.

## Philosophy

Spaced Repetition Software is great.  It adds a huge amount of efficiency by
studying the items that need to be studied.  And yet, most study time is still
spent going through remembered items.  A possible improvement for this is to
review in lists rather than as individual cards, since there are many fewer
steps for each review item.  (I used to use a similar system on paper, largely
because it was less work to create the lists than decks of cards - and
sometimes even just used the list in the textbook.)

This is an experiment in whether this kind of thing is something worth
pursuing.
