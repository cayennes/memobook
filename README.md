# Memobook

A computer implementation of studying via lists instead of flashcards.  It has
some hardcoded Japanese vocab from the Genki textbook, and a few sentences from
よつばと！.

I'm slowly working on it, but currently that's taking the form of inexplicable
half-features.

## Philosophy

Spaced Repetition Software is great.  It adds a huge amount of efficiency by
studying the items that need to be studied.  And yet, most study time is still
spent going through remembered items.  A possible improvement for this is to
review in lists rather than as individual cards, since there are many fewer
steps for each review item.  (I used to use a similar system on paper, largely
because it was less work to create the lists than decks of cards - and
sometimes even just used the list in the textbook.)

Memobook doesn't realize the dream of the best of both worlds, but it has an
interface close to what I imagine such a thing would have.  It's an experiment
in whether this kind of approach is something worth pursuing.
